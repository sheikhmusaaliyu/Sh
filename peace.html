<h2> Message to Muslims and Christians and monks, mystics, and hermits.</h2>

 <strong>SHEIKH MUSA ALIYU</strong>



<p>We are in a special time when peace is most needed. The good thing is that we can all contribute to it. Achieving a sense of peace is not limited to monks, mystics, and hermits. The truth is that we all benefit from peace for our own wellbeing. And, peace can be achieved even in home with family and at work place with co-workers. We know that peaceful people live much happier lives than others. Peace, inner peace, or peace of mind is a state of being mentally, emotionally, and spiritually at peace in face of daily stresses, anxieties, worries, disturbances, and chaos. It is consciously keeping our mind at peace regardless of external circumstances, including what people might think or say about us<p>

<h2>How can I achieve peace?</h2>

<p>Every day, there are many ways to accomplish that, including practicing:

<br> Gratitude<br>

<br> Meditation<br>

<br> Patience<br>

<br> Listening<br>

<br> Exercising<br>

<br> Forgiveness<br>

<br> Relaxation<br>

<br> Caring for others<br>

<br> Clearing the mind<br>

<br> Thinking before speaking<br>

<br> Reasoning before responding<br>

<br> Loving adversaries<br>
</p>

<p>However, People are weary and worried. Without a doubt there is a need for direction and counsel, security and confidence. We need, and want, peace of mind.
On Peace of mindâ€”what a treasure! Can this treasure be found in a world of so much conflict and despair, turmoil and trouble?

The great search is on! Many people are seeking peace in fame and fortune, in pleasure and power, in education and knowledge, in human relationships and marriage. They desire to fill their heads with knowledge and their purses with wealth, but their souls remain empty. Others are seeking to escape the realities of life with drugs or alcohol, but the peace they seek eludes them. They are still empty and lonely, still in a troubled world with a troubled mind.</p>
