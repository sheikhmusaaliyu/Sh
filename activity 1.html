<h2>SPIRITUAL WELLNESS</h2>
<p>Interfaith dialogue refers to cooperative, constructive, and positive interaction between people of different religious traditions (i.e. "faiths") and/or spiritual or humanistic beliefs, at both the individual and institutional levels. ... "interreligious" as "relations with other religions.</p>


<h2>INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUE</h2>
 <p>Occurs when members of different cultural groups, who hold conflicting opinions and assumptions, speak to one another in acknowledgment of those differences". It builds upon the concept of dialogue, which refers to at least two people holding a conversation.</p>


<h2>PEACE BUILDING</h2>
<p>Communicators, advocates, and peace builders, we know how important it is to talk about peace. It's also really hard. Our day-to-day work is filled with tragic stories. Violent headlines grab readers' attention quickly and effectively. But we know from research that crisis fatigue is real: </p>

<h2>CONFLICT TRANSFORMATION</h2>

<p>Conflict transformation, in contrast, places a greater weight on addressing the underlying conditions which give rise to that conflict, preferably well in advance of any hostility, but also to ensure a sustainable peace. In other terms, it attempts to make explicit and then reshape the social structures and dynamics behind the conflict, often employing analytical tools borrowed from systems thinking. "The very structure of parties and relationships may be embedded in a pattern of conflictual relationships that extend beyond the particular site of conflict. Conflict transformation is therefore a process of engaging with and transforming the relationships, interests, discourses and, if necessary, the very constitution of society that supports the continuation of violent conflict.</p>

<h2>HUMANITARIAN ACTIONS</h2>

<p>The Nigeria we live in is one of extremes. We have a wealth of possibilities available to us for the compassionate, connective and creative expression of our humanness, but these exist side by side with misguided, fear-based behaviors that anchor us in the same divisiveness, conflict and suffering that have held humanity back for thousands of years…
And while many people throughout the Nigeria continue to awaken to the foundational Oneness of everything in the Universe, most of them don’t yet fully grasp the implications of that connection giving each of us access to the power of the Universe itself to manifest the positive expressions we are inspired to create in our own lives and in the lives of others. 
<br>
One of the most effective ways of tuning into and channeling that power is through the way we use our own eyes to “see” and interpret the Nigeria around us. To help you master this universal ability, the Sheikh Musa Aliy respected spiritual teacher have come together to share with you the unique skills and insights that will enable you to avoid getting held back by the negative and destructive elements in the Nigeria, and make it possible for you to instead be a more potent and effective force for positive expression and change.</p>
