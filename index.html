<h2>INTERFAITH DIALOGUE</h2>

<p>The term 'Interfaith Dialogue' refers to the positive and cooperative interaction between people of different religions, faiths or spiritual beliefs, with the aim of promoting understanding between different religions to increase acceptance and tolerance. It is an expression of the participants' lived faith lives, and therefore interfaith encounters form communities of awareness. Constructing dialogue between followers of different religions means understanding, through cooperation, the different religious principles and teachings that should benefit all of humanity through the promotion of mutual respect and tolerance. It means coming together and sharing aspects of their respective faiths and striving to understand that which is foreign. What is essential in this respect is that the participants engaging in dialogue lay aside attempts to missionize, which is always accompanied by an attitude of exclusive superiority and can be equated with the spoken or unspoken belief that one's own religion is the "true" way, or effectively the only way.
<br>
The power of religion can be used as a major force of unification among divergent factions, and hence it can play a key role in the promotion of global peace and reconciliation, by bringing varying groups together in order to establish and maintain constructive channels of communication and sustainable collaboration. Interfaith dialogue therefore plays a vital role in the field of Cultural Diplomacy, as it can advance world peace by uniting faiths and by fostering reciprocal understanding, acceptance and tolerance amongst disparate religious communities. Inter-faith dialogue can in this way break down walls of division and the barriers that stand at the center of numerous wars, with the objective of achieving peace.</p>

<aside><h2>The Ten Commandments<br>[ The Doctrine of Deception ]</h2>

<p>It is bad to think that every person believes in Allah ( Good )
God Almighty said: And if it is too old for you to turn them away, then if 
you are able to seek a tunnel on earth or a peace in the sky, then bring them a 
verse, and if God wills to gather them on guidance, then you are not among 
the ignorant (35) the cattle
The Messenger does not force anyone to believe. The disavowal of these 
people is a deliberate matter of the duty of existence in order to test them, 
and if he wanted that, he wanted to see them to do so, for everyone is 
obedient to God, and everything in the universe is obedient, including 
animals that are devoted to serving man. <br> 1- I gave a choice to a person.
<br>2- Faith and disbelief is a system of willGod Almighty said: follow what has 
been revealed to you from your Lord 
there is no god but He, and introduce the infidels (106) If God wills what 
Pagans blame his sentences infidels (106) If God wills what Pagans and did 
not your sentences.
The issue that Almighty God Almighty has made is an issue that we must 
accompany in our history of faith, and the issue is: that an unbeliever 
compulsion from God, but disbelief, because God has given him the reins 
over the choice in his creation by choice, but he did what God has given him 
of the choice in order for our Lord to take the nature of the choice from God 
. And when God singled out the human being by choosing, he set the method 
upon which reward and punishment would be established.
It is forbidden to regret the infidels 
<br>3-Perhaps you will scold yourself for their traces if they do not believe in this 
hadith unfortunately (6) The Cave
God Almighty said: And if your Lord had willed, all of them on the earth 
would have believed all of them, so do you hate people until they are 
believers (99) Yunus
And exalted willingly, he makes for man the right to choose and dedicates 
the universe to him, and among the people there are those who believe, and
among the people there are those who disbelieve, and even from the 
believers who obey once and disobey, it is the right's will to balance the 
universe, so every attribute of goodness if there is someone who opposes in 
it this is what God Almighty wills for man Do not be sad, Messenger of 
God. Right, Almighty God willed that.
<br>4- Difference in religion is the system of creation
God Almighty said: And if your Lord willed, to make people a single nation 
and still be different (118) except for those who have mercy on your Lord 
and that is why He created them and the word of your Lord was fulfilled to 
fill Hell with heaven and all people (119) Hood
And we are that man has come into this universe after God Almighty created 
in this universe all the components of life. Mockery of God’s command for 
this person. To exercise the task of succession in the land; The memory of 
living things, whether he is a believer or an unbeliever; Because the Truth, 
Glory be to Him, is that which summoned man into existence, and as long as 
He summoned him; He, may He be glorified, will not be insulted by the 
elements of this existence Of survival is life, survival is kind.
Can he play his role in obtaining a lot of programs that can perform one role 
that leads to his role in obtaining the system of the will of God Almighty?
<br>5- God is the one ruling over the issue of religion on the Day of Resurrection
God Almighty said: Therefore, pray and stand straight as I commanded and 
do not follow their whims and say I have believed in what God has revealed 
from the book and ordered to do justice between you. God is our Lord and 
your Lord. Our deeds are yours and your deeds are not an argument.</p>
