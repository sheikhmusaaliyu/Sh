<h2>SPIRITUAL TERMS</h2>

<p>In this field, Sheikh Musa Aliyu and Terms will gain an understanding of human conflict and consider ways of responding to conflict and violence that promote peace.  Interpersonal and international conflicts are analyzed from an interdisciplinary perspective –with courses in Psychology, International Development, and Communications and Media, among many others – to learn about the multi-layered, dynamic nature of conflict. Majoring in Nigeria will prepare terms to understand and interact constructively with personal, local, and global conflict situations.</p>

<p>Peace and Conflict Transformation Studies encourages terms to develop the skills to work toward and imagine a more peaceful and just Nigeria.
